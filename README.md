# Non-Blocking AVL tree with Memory Reclamation Scheme
An algorithm for reclaiming the unused shared memory without blocking the memory for AVL tree is presented. Here Hazard pointers memory reclamation scheme is used. The proposed Non-BLocking AVL tree is also benchmarked with other existing memory reclamation schemes and varying workload proportion of reads and inserts.
